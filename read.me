# Voxel-wise Radiomics Feature Extraction

This project provides a Python tool for extracting voxel-wise radiomics features from 3D MRI images using corresponding tumor masks. The tool leverages [SimpleITK](https://simpleitk.org/) for image handling and [PyRadiomics](https://pyradiomics.readthedocs.io/) for feature extraction (specifically GLCM and GLDM features).

## Features

- **Resampling:** Automatically resamples the mask image to match the geometry of the MRI if necessary.
- **Voxel-wise Extraction:** Computes voxel-based GLCM and GLDM features without cropping the original MRI dimensions.
- **Output:** Saves each feature map as a separate 3D NIfTI (`.nii.gz`) file retaining the original MRI's size, spacing, and orientation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- [SimpleITK](https://pypi.org/project/SimpleITK/)
- [PyRadiomics](https://pypi.org/project/pyradiomics/)
